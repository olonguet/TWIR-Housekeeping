These were assembler written "demos" for the This Week in Retro podcast, done as a way to learn Amiga Assembler.
They are written to run on a standard Amiga 500 with a single 512k of chip ram.
My goal was mostly to learn assembler and some "tricks" like copper bars, wobble, bounce, mirror effects along with sprites, dual playfield and some parallax scrolling
Code isn't exactly optimized but it runs smooth enough for me :)

the .adf file should also contain a folder with all image and sounds assets when you insert the floppy from kickstart
